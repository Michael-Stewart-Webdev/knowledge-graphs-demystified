## Knowledge Graphs Demystified Part 2: Practical Session

This is the repository for the practical session of the "Knowledge Graphs Demystified" master class by Dr Michael Stewart.

In this session I will be demonstrating a jupyter notebook containing code for creating a knowledge graph from a set of sample work orders.

The notebook is located here: [Knowledge Graphs Demystified.ipynb](<https://github.com/Michael-Stewart-Webdev/knowledge-graphs-demystified/blob/main/Knowledge Graphs Demystified.ipynb>).
